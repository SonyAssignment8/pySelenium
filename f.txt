Constructors are not methods and they donâ€™t have any return type.
Constructor name should match with class name .
Constructor can use any access specifier, they can be declared as private also.
Private constructors are possible in java but there scope is within the class only.
Like constructors method can also have name same as class name,
but still they have return type, though which we can identify them that they are methods not constructors.
